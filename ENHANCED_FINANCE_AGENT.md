## 🤖 AI-Powered Financial Analysis

### How Gemini LLM Enhances Financial Advice

The Finance Agent uses Google Gemini to provide intelligent, context-aware financial strategies:

#### **📊 Comprehensive Context Analysis**
```
FARM PROFILE ANALYSIS:
- Location: Maharashtra (considers regional market conditions)
- Crop: Cotton (incorporates crop-specific economics)
- Land Size: 8 acres (determines scale-appropriate strategies)
- Current Costs: ₹45,000 fertilizer, ₹60,000 water (identifies optimization areas)
- Yield: 150 quintals (benchmarks against regional averages)
```

#### **🎯 Dynamic Strategy Generation**
- **Cost Optimization Queries:** Focus on input efficiency, technology adoption, operational improvements
- **Profit Maximization Queries:** Emphasize revenue enhancement, value addition, market diversification
- **Investment Planning Queries:** Analyze scalability, financing options, risk assessment
- **Economics Analysis:** Provide comprehensive financial health assessment

#### **📈 Intelligent Output Features**
- **Quantified Benefits:** "Reduce fertilizer costs by 20-30% through soil testing"
- **Implementation Timelines:** "Immediate actions (30 days), Short-term goals (3-6 months)"
- **Regional Adaptation:** Considers local market conditions and agricultural practices
- **Risk Assessment:** Analyzes market, credit, operational, and liquidity risks

#### **🔄 Fallback System**
If Gemini is unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to structured, parameter-based advice ensuring consistent service.

### 🤔 Interactive Follow-up Questions

The Finance Agent intelligently determines when more information is needed and asks targeted follow-up questions:

#### **📊 Smart Detection Logic**
- **Insufficient Data:** Triggers when basic farm info (land size, production) is missing
- **Optimization Queries:** Requires farm size + 2+ cost parameters for comprehensive advice
- **Profit Analysis:** Needs production data and at least basic cost information
- **General Advice:** Asks questions when less than 2 parameters are available

#### **🤖 AI-Generated Questions**
When Gemini is available, questions are intelligently generated based on:
- **Query Context:** "I want to optimize costs" → focuses on expense-related questions
- **Available Data:** Asks for missing critical parameters first
- **Farm Profile:** Considers location and crop for relevant questions
- **Goals:** Tailors questions to farmer's specific objectives

#### **📝 Example Follow-up Response**
```markdown
## 🤔 Let me help you with personalized financial advice!

I understand you want to **optimize costs and improve efficiency**. 
To provide the most effective recommendations, I need a few more details about your farm.

### 📊 Please share the following information:

**1. Farm Size:** How many acres of land do you cultivate?
**2. Annual Production:** What is your current annual yield (in quintals)?
**3. Annual Expenses:** What do you spend annually on fertilizers, water/irrigation, and labor?
**4. Technology Usage:** What type of irrigation do you use? Do you own tractors or heavy machinery?
**5. Investment Capacity:** What is your budget for improvements or new investments?

### 💡 Why these details matter:
• **Farm size & production:** Helps determine scale-appropriate strategies
• **Current expenses:** Identifies optimization opportunities  
• **Technology usage:** Assesses upgrade potential and ROI
• **Financial goals:** Ensures recommendations align with your priorities

📝 You can provide this information in your next message, and I'll generate a comprehensive financial strategy tailored specifically for your farm!
```

#### **🎯 Fallback Questions**
When AI is unavailable, structured questions cover:

- **Cost Breakdown:** Fertilizers, water, labor, machinery
- **Technology Assessment:** Irrigation type, equipment ownership
- **Investment Goals:** Budget and improvement priorities

## 📊 Adding Your Crop Price Data

### Method 1: Update the JSON Template

1. Edit `services/api/data/crop_prices_template.json`
2. Add your crops following this structure:

```json
{
  "crop_name": {
    "current_price": 2500,
    "currency": "INR/quintal",
    "trend": "increasing",
    "market_locations": ["State1", "State2"],
    "peak_season": "Month-Month",
    "min_price": 2300,
    "max_price": 2700,
    "demand": "high",
    "price_history": [
      {"date": "2024-01-01", "price": 2400},
      {"date": "2024-02-01", "price": 2450},
      {"date": "2024-03-01", "price": 2500}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Modify the Finance Agent Code

Update the `_load_crop_prices()` method in `services/api/app/agents/finance_agent.py`:

```python
def _load_crop_prices(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Option 1: Load from external JSON file
    try:
        with open('data/crop_prices.json', 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            return data.get('crop_prices', {})
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    
    # Option 2: Connect to your database
    # return self._fetch_from_database()
    
    # Option 3: API integration
    # return self._fetch_from_api()
    
    # Fallback to default data
    return {
        "your_crop": {
            "current_price": 1500,
            "currency": "INR/quintal",
            # ... rest of the structure
        }
    }
```

        "type": "float", 
        "description": "Description for user",
        "required": False
    }
}
```

Update pattern recognition in `_extract_financial_data_from_query()`:

```python
